		<h3 class="mat-title">About Multi-Sports Fitness Trend</h3>
		The fitness trend is "Multi-sports" oriented as long as you hold a <i>heart rate monitor</i> and/or <i>cycling.
		power meter</i> and/or <i>swimming activities having distance & time</i>. The trend is calculated from your
		various heart rate stress,
		and/or cycling power stress and/or swimming stress given in your activities.
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="mat-title">Heart Rate Stress Score (all workout types)</h3>
		A heart rate stress is represented by a value called <i>TRaining IMPulse</i> or <i>TRIMP</i>. Training Impulse
		concept has been developed by Dr. Eric W. Banister. Basically, it represents the amount of heart stress during
		an activity: the longer you go at full throttle during an activity, the more <i>TRIMP</i> of activity goes up!
		<i>TRIMP</i> has both a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is called <i>fitness</i>,
		and the negative effect is called <i>fatigue</i>. <i>Fitness</i> and <i>fatigue</i> can combined to provide a
		value of <i>form</i> & <i>Performance</i>.
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="mat-title">Power Stress Score (cycling only)</h3>
		If you own a power meter and you activated the cycling power meter option in the feature, then the "Power Stress
		Score (PSS)" will be used instead of TRIMP on cycling activities only if available.
	</div>

	<div>
		<i>Note: PSS is equivalent to Training Stress Score&reg; (TSS&reg;) from TrainingPeaks&trade;. <a

	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 class="mat-title">Swimming Stress Score</h3>
		A "Swimming Stress Score" (Swim SS) can be computed for each of your swim activities if your "Swimming
		Functional Threshold Pace" (Swim FTP) has been entered inside athlete settings and you enabled swimming stress
		score option. No heart rate monitor is required. Even a swimming manual activity will be handled by the system.

	<div>
		<i>Note: Strava do not support HR data for swimming activities at the moment. In the case where you have
			HRM while swimming and strava finally support HR data then TRIMP value will be used instead of Swim SS</i>

	<div>
		The Fitness, Fatigue and Form graph and table is based off an impulse-response model first developed by Dr. Eric
		W. Banister in 1975. It was later redefined by <a href="http://www.peakscoachinggroup.com/DrAndrewCoggan"
														  target="_blank">Andrew R. Coggan</a>.
		This model will show you:
		<ul>
			<li>Your <i>Fitness</i> based on your chronic load</li>
			<li>Your <i>Fatigue</i> based on your acute load</li>
			<li>Your <i>Form</i> or stress balance</li>
		</ul>

		At a glance

		<ul>
			<li>
				The <i>Fitness</i> curve is the long-term average daily training load. Default period is fixed to 42
				days (or six weeks), so it will take ~6 weeks for your <i>Fitness</i> to be accurate. It's basically the
				foundations, the potential availability of the athlete... You can't get into big rides/runs or races
				without a minimum of fitness acquired. If that curve is too regular or too flat, it is not usually a
				sign of good training.
			</li>

			<li>
				The <i>Fatigue</i> curve is the short-term average daily training load. Same way than <i>Fitness</i> but
				default period is fixed to 7 days (one week). Conceptually, fatigue is easy to understand: It's the
				tired feelings which limits your performance. This curve varies much faster than <i>Fitness</i> curve.
				On <i>Fatigue</i> curve, you can see the fatigue climbing sharply in response where you performed
				workouts with a high stress. But also go down quickly as you take few days off.
			</li>

			<li>
				The <i>Form</i> curve is simply the difference between <i>Fitness</i> and <i>Fatigue</i>, it's the right
				balance of stress you should look at to avoid over training for example.
				<div>
					<i>Form = Fitness - Fatigue</i>
				</div>

				When:
				<ul>
					<li><i>+25 < Form :</i> Transition zone. Athlete is on form. Case where athlete has an
						extended break. (e.g. illness, injury or end of the season).
					</li>
					<li><i>+5 < Form < +25 :</i> Freshness Zone. Athlete is on form. Ready for a race.</li>
					<li><i>-10 < Form < +5 :</i> Neutral Zone. Zone reached typically when athlete is in a rest
						or recovery week. After a race or hard training period.
					</li>
					<li><i>-30 < Form < -10 :</i> Optimal Training Zone.</li>
					<li><i>Form < -30 :</i> Over Load Zone. Athlete is on overload or over-training phase. They
						should take a rest!
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<div>
				Be fit doesn't mean you are ready to race at your higher level. A negative <i>Form</i> would reveal that
				you are carrying fatigue and are not on form. By resting you can remove fatigue faster than you lose
				fitness and come into form for your race day (or punish friend day... ;))!
