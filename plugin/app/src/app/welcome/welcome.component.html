		A new app for a new start!

		<div>
			After 7 months of hard work and more than 50 liters of coffee, the brand new StravistiX App is here!
		</div>
		<div>
			<strong>But... Why everything has been rebuild from scratch?</strong>
		</div>
		<div>
			Because...
			<ul>
				<li>The old application was made with 2010's web technologies which tends to be deprecated in the next
					months: <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS (v1)</a></li>
				<li>It makes more sense to produce the newest features with up to date technologies. And thus avoid an
					even bigger technical migration work in the upcoming years.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<i>Geek note: Technology now being used is <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular
				(v5)</a></i>
		</div>
		<div>
			This new app improves existing features on some points. She's also a way
			more reliable than the previous one and the global performance has been increased.
		</div>
		<div>
			<strong>So what's the roadmap from now?</strong>
		</div>
		<div>
			Basically, every big features which have been postponed by this required technical switch:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Custom year progression targets</strong>: Define your targets for various set of sports and
					a data
					type (distance, time, ...)
				</li>
				<li><strong>Dashboard</strong>: Interrogate your history on a period. By sports, by bike, by shoes...
					Customisable.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Grid</strong>: All your activities and stats in a table. Exportable to a spreadsheet. Mostly
					done in old app. Rebuild required.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Fitness trend planner</strong>: Simulate futures efforts (stress scores) and prepare
					yourself for
					the D-Day.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Fitness trend for all</strong>: A simple smartphone will be sufficient to access fitness
					trend feature. Extension will estimate your running and cycling stress scores without heart rate
					monitor and/or power meters.
				</li>
			</ul>
