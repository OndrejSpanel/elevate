            Multi sports fitness trend is calculated from your various heart rate stress. A heart rate stress is
            represented by an value called <i>TRaining IMPulse</i> or <i>TRIMP</i>.
            Training Impulse concept has been developed by Dr. Eric W. Banister. Basically, it represents the amount of
            heart stress
            during an activity: the longer you go at full
            throttle during an activity, the more <i>TRIMP</i> of activity goes up!

            <div style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <i>TRIMP</i> has both a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is called <i>fitness</i>,
                and the negative
                effect is called <i>fatigue</i>. <i>Fitness</i> and <i>fatigue</i> can combined to provide a value of
                <i>form</i> or <i>Performance</i>.

            <div style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                The fitness trend drawn in the graph is computed over a model called <i>Training Stress Balance
                (TSB)</i>.
                This model uses following terms:
                <ul>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><i>Fitness</i> or <i>Chronic Training Load (CTL)</i></li>
                    <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><i>Fatigue</i> or <i>Acute Training Load (ATL)</i></li>
                    <li><i>Form</i> or <i>Training Stress Balance (TSB)</i></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            Explanations...
            <ul>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                    The <i>Chronic Training Load (CTL)</i> or <i>Fitness</i> is the long-term average daily training
                    load.
                    By default period is fixed to 42 days (or six weeks), so it will take ~6 weeks for your
                    <i>fitness</i>
                    to be accurate. <i>CTL</i> is basically "house's foundation", the potential availability of the
                    athlete... You can't get into big rides/runs or races without a minimum of fitness acquired. A too
                    regular or too flat <i>CTL</i> is not usually a sign of good training.
                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                    The <i>Acute Training Load (ATL)</i> or <i>Fatigue</i> is the short-term average daily training
                    load.
                    Same way than <i>CTL</i> but
                    default period is fixed to 7 days (one week). Conceptually, fatigue is easy to understand: It's the
                    tired feelings which limits your performance. This curve varies much faster than <i>CTL</i>. On <i>ATL</i>
                    curve, you can see the fatigue climbing sharply in response where you performed workouts with a high
                    stress.
                    You do a hard workout today and you will feel it in the coming days. But also go down quickly as you
                    take few days off.
                </li>

                <li style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
                    The <i>Training Stress Balance (TSB)</i> or <i>Form</i> is the difference between <i>CTL</i> and
                    <i>ATL</i>:
                    <br/><br/>
                    TSB = CTL-ATL
                    <br/><br/>
                    When...
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TSB > 0: Athlete in form, sharp or under-training phase.</li>
                        <li>TSB < 0: Athlete on overload or over-training phase.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    Note that being fit does not mean that you are ready to race at your best. A negative Form would
                    indicate that you are carrying a lot of fatigue and are not on form. However, by resting you can
                    evacuate fatigue at a greater rate than you lose fitness and come into form on the day that matters
                    most... Race day (or punish friend day... ;))! In short, <i>Fitness</i> minus <i>Fatigue</i> equals
                    <i>Form</i>.
